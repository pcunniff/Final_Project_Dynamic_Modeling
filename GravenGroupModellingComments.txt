# Comments on Mac Graven's Group Project for Dynamic Modelling
# By Zach Bonstetter, Patrick Cunniff, Cole Grabowski

###### Comments below:

# Python Code for LV Model:
# Might be more effective to show how parameters are changing each time rather than giving new numerical values
# For example, define parameters and save them to a variable, then in params have it be params = (a*2,b,s,w,...)

# More comments are always helpful to describe what is actually going on in code
# Very helpful for other people looking at your code for the first time and also for when you look back at this code in the far future

####### Python Code for RM Model:

# More comments which is helpful

# In the LV model, he suggests making the range in time steps of 0.1
# Might be a good idea to carry this over into RM model simulations as well (see LV code)

# Maybe do the same thing with the parameters as suggested in comments for LV code

# Simulations 4 and 5 are miscommented (a/alpha is not predator attack rate, w is predator search rate or attack rate)

# Simulation 8, doubled d when the comment says it is tripled (either is fine, but just clarify which you are doing)

# Finish Paradox of Enrichment

# Rest of Code Looks really really good
